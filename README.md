# StarRun

StarRun is a no-steering, no-aiming roguelite autoshooter. The ship flies and fires automatically; the player chooses its build and *when* to use four equipped active abilities.

## Gameplay: v0.7 equipment and phone controls

- **Four active slots from 20 original abilities.** Every ship starts with a signature ability. Each ability has a matching partner; collecting the pair makes a stronger fused ability and frees a slot. Ten fusions are available.
- **Normal, Hard, Insane.** Choose the difficulty before launch. Higher settings increase enemy health, damage and firing pressure, with respective core rewards of **1×, 1.75×, and 2.5×**.
- **Stage 1: Debris Belt.** Fly through changing scenery and enemy waves, then defeat the Harvester. A full Hangar can make this stage easy, by design.
- **Stage 2: Ion Storm.** A fully different cobalt lightning environment, new electrical silhouettes, ion shield suppression, corrosion, ability disruption and the Storm Carrier.
- **Stage 3: Solar Foundry.** Molten orange factory corridors, Forge Turrets, Slag Bombers, Ember Hunters and Splitters. Heat impairs automatic weapons; molten bombs are visible and shootable. The Crucible Engine is the boss.
- **Stage 4: Void Citadel.** Violet fortress architecture, blinking Phase Stalkers, Void Lancers, Gravity Sentinels and Echo Carriers. Gravity slows weapon fire; void shots partially bypass shields; the Void Regent fires twin telegraphed beams.
- **Tactical multi-part bosses.** Storm Carrier has targetable fighter-launch bays; Crucible Engine has cooling vents and alternating armored/exposed windows; Void Regent has shield pylons and a final onslaught. Autopilot weapons can prioritize these real weak points—no aiming or steering required.
- **Build bonuses.** Fortress, Glass Cannon, Control and Salvager remain meaningful, even if their source skills fuse. Eight weapon/system pairs grant additional passive effects, with no extra ability buttons.
- **Eight Prototypes.** Between stages, choose one permanent run-changing Prototype from three random, save-stable choices. Prototypes boost durability, damage, cooldowns, boss targeting or core income—but always with a cost.
- **Choose your next route.** After the warp and Prototype draft, choose **Safe Passage** (big repair), **Redline Jump** (+25% next-stage automatic damage, limited repairs/shields), or **High-Risk Contract** (+30% enemy pressure, additional cores for beating the next boss). Decisions persist through checkpoints.
- **Boss victories are earned moments.** Defeating a boss freezes combat for oversized explosions and shockwaves. Tap **Warp to next stage**, pick a Prototype and route, and receive an extra level-up before the next stage. After Stage 4, tap **Claim victory** for the full report.
- **Phone-first menus.** Title, Hangar, Ships & pilots, drafts, intermissions and results share one layout system: header on top, actions pinned to the bottom within thumb reach, and safe-area margins for the notch and home indicator. Every draft option is visible at once and the whole card is the tap target. Permanent unlocks, Refund all and abandoning a saved flight take a second tap or a confirmation. The first flight opens with a four-step briefing.
- **Meaningful timing.** Aegis base cooldown is 14 seconds and Nova is 20 seconds. Chaff, heavy telegraphs, ordnance, mines and stage-specific suppression require different responses.
- **Real milestones at ranks 5 and 10.** Every one of the 35 upgrade tracks gets a breakpoint effect. Later picks add two ranks; crossing rank 5 or 10 triggers the effect immediately, even if the choice skipped that exact number.
- **Six ships and six pilots.** Each ship has a distinct flight, weapon and signature-ability starting package. Pilots provide additional specialties.
- **Persistent Hangar.** Twenty-two refundable permanent upgrades enhance weapons, defense, ability power, draft tools and salvage. Equipment and selected difficulty are retained in saves.

Current active pool: Aegis, Nova, Barrage, Overdrive, Chrono, Repair Drones, Flak Screen, EMP Blackout, Deflector, Rail Strike, Prism Reversal, Chaff Barrier, Capacitor, Precision Focus, Decoy Beacon, Signal Jammer, Energy Siphon, Chain Overload, Reactor Reboot, Salvage Surge.

## Controls

On iPhone, four compact on-screen buttons run left to right on one row. Fused abilities use just one button. On keyboard, use **1–4** (Space uses slot 1); **B** opens the build, **Tab** cycles play speed and **Esc/P** pauses. Controller **A / X / Y / B** activates slots 1–4; Start pauses. Level-up choices use keys 1–4 or touch.

The playfield uses adaptive 390×844 logical canvas scaling on modern portrait iPhones. Phone UI text uses a 16-point minimum. Build and Results use pinned navigation, short summaries and word-wrapped detail. iOS readability and performance still need real-device validation.

## Building and running

Pinned to **Godot 4.6.3**, GDScript and the Compatibility renderer. GitHub Actions performs simulation and responsive UI checks, builds Web/Windows/Linux, and compiles an unsigned native iPhone application. Shared Apple signing credentials are in the companion TestFlight release workflow; no secrets are stored in this repo.

```sh
godot --headless --path . --editor --import --quit
godot --headless --path . --script tests/ui_smoke.gd
godot --headless --path . --script tests/run.gd
mkdir -p build/web build/windows build/linux
godot --headless --path . --export-release Web build/web/index.html
python3 tools/package-web.py build/web
godot --headless --path . --export-release Windows build/windows/StarRun.exe
godot --headless --path . --export-release Linux build/linux/StarRun.x86_64
```

Web requires WebGL2; Windows may show an unsigned application warning. Godot's 60 Hz simulation is independent of renderer and platform services, with deterministic seeds and exact checkpoint serialization.

**v0.7 adds fused abilities, passive pairings and improved phone navigation; real-device UAT remains required.** Passing simulation, responsive UI and iOS compile does not establish human enjoyment, actual iPhone frame-time stability, ads or in-app purchase support. Signed TestFlight release status is checked separately.
